2_1_1: Create Deadlock - Instead of using mutex semaphore, every philosopher should 
    lock both forks when he takes them. This will significantly increase 
    the chance of Deadlock, since everyone may take the right fork and wait 
    for the left fork.
    
2_1_2: Solve Deadlock - forks will be numbered 1 through 5 and each philosopher will 
    always pick up the lower-numbered fork first, and then the higher-numbered fork. 
    In this case, if four of the five philosophers simultaneously pick up their lower-numbered fork, 
    only the highest-numbered fork will remain on the table, so the fifth philosopher will not 
    be able to pick up any fork. Moreover, only one philosopher will have access to that highest-numbered fork, 
    so they will be able to eat using two forks. This method can cause starvation but it will never create deadlock.

2_2_1: create Starvation - By deleting the two lines waking up the nearby philosophers, 
    the first philosopher never wakes up the other philosophers. And so he ran alone 
    while they starving.
    
2_2_2: Solve Starvation - 

2_3_1: Create Livelock - To create a livelock, we defined that each philosopher first takes 
    the fork to the right and then tries to take the fork to the left. 
    If after 5 seconds of trying to take the fork he fails, he will put down
    the right fork and wait for 5 seconds. This loop will be repeated 
    until the philosopher has both forks and can eat. When the five philosophers
    raise the right fork at the same time, a livelock will be created, 
    as they will constantly raise all the forks at the same time.
    
2_3_2: Solve Livelock -
